# Bankroll Manager

Bankroll Manager is an app that helps user keep track of their bankroll. The user signs up and adds a bankroll. Then they are able to monitor their buy-ins and receive suggestions on which buy-ins are appropriate for their bankroll. This app allows users to easily monitor their bankroll. Having good bankroll management is the first step to becoming a profitable poker player. Currently this app uses an article from [my poker coaching's website ](https://www.mypokercoaching.com/poker-bankroll-management-strategy-tips/) for it's bankroll management strategy.
